		<h1> Who am I?</h1>
		<p>In 2018, I graduated with First Class in BSc Computer Science and Multimedia from Queen Mary, 
			University in London. I'm currently working as a software engineer in finance. However, 
			having studied design at Goldsmiths before, I want to combine my creativity with enthusiasm for 
			coding. I am very interested in working with aesthetic designs, games, AR/VR and I spend most of 
			my free time making games in Unity or learning 3D modelling and animation in Blender and Autodesk Maya.
		</p>
			<p>Travelling is another passion of mine. During my time at university I did one year exchange at Nanyang Technological 
				University in Singapore, where I met talented people from different backgrounds.
				After my graduation, I went to Seoul, South Korea for a year, where I was teaching English.
				I love meeting new people, exploring different cultures, traditions and of course eating local foods.
